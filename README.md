## Wethos: Front End Excercise 11/1/17
Thank you for taking the time to review this submission.

## Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build` to compile
3. Run `npm start` to start server
4. Open `http://localhost:8080` to view

## TODO

#### React Components
 * Complete BlockThird, BlockFourth, and BlockFifth and make responsive following the responsive styling of the above blocks (i.e. stack components vertically as appropriate)

#### MobileNav
 * Style toggle transition of dropdown using `react-transition-group` to expand and collapse height
 
#### Carousel
 * Complete carousel using `react-responsive-carousel` component
 
#### Footer
 * Constrain spacing/padding between social icons on device widths above 1000px (so they are not so spread out)

#### Note on fonts
  * For the purpose of this excercise I opted to import fonts from GoogleFonts instead of installing the provided fonts because, in general, the mock-up did not appear to use the provided font.
  * To use a downloaded font, I would install it with the @font-face css rule
  
#### Note on cross-browser consistency
 * In the past I have used `autoprefixer` and `normalize` to control for cross-browser consistency. I attempted to include these in this excercise but ran into bugs. With more time, I would resolve these bugs and also test the excercise on a variety of devices and browsers. The current iteration has been tested on Chrome on a MacBook.
